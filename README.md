## About this Project

# Rappelz-Launcher-V3
Rappelz launcher v3 with autologin feature
This launcher was initially based on two public projects:

1. **Reference Forum:**  
   The original discussion and structure were obtained from the ElitePvPers forum:  
   [Rappelz Private Server Discussion](https://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/rappelz-private-server)

2. **Base Project:**  
   The initial source code was adapted from the project:  
   **"Launcher by Montesboogey"**

### Modifications and Improvements Implemented

Since the original version, I have made some alterations, including the implementation of new features such as:

- **Auto-login System** – Automatic login and credential management (securely stored)
- Fixes for bugs present in the original version
- Performance and stability improvements
